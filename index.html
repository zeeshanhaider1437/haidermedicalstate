        Medical field has produced a number of miracles in the last two centuries around the globe.
        In Pakistan, it is one of the leading professions.  
        In contemporary times, the need for medical professionals is increasing due to the rise 
        in diseases in the 21st century. Modern equipment supports diagnosis, yet it remains a challenging field.
        Adequate learning is essential to help people in need. Best learning depends on course selection
        and the mentor’s ability to deliver. Students are evaluated through examinations, and passing
        all stages prepares them to lead juniors in the future.
